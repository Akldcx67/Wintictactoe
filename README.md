# Wintictactoe

This is a small dextop application written in C# for Windows on the .NET framework and on the WinForms GUI. It's basically a minimalistic Paint, it has the main things, but no last action cancellation for example. There are also bugs and features. I put this little project as a keepsake so it doesn't just lie around
